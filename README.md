XP Values
Communication
Team members constantly reported their status week after week. Whenever there was a confusion, any team member was welcomed to speak up and express their thoughts. We did not have any arguments due to the fact that it was an open space to share.
There was a moment where tensions were high due to the stress of the assignment and lack of progress, but we all expressed to each other that this is our learning experience and we should try and proceed at our own pace even if we might not submit something completely.
Simplicity
We wanted to try and get to the core aspect of the project. Our value was functionality over visibility. Rather than having something look pretty, we want it to work properly. This was a huge factor of what we all believed we wanted to achieve.
